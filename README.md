# SaduskoBOT
This is a bot that will answer your questions. It is not fully functioning yet but this is something we are working on. Please be patient!

## What will it help me with?
The top most supported systems/games are Steam, Unturned and Rocket. More to be added in the future.

## How does it work?
Whenever you send in a question it will search a list (available on the wiki) where he will find if any word in your chat contains that specific word and it will send you the answer to it.

### Can I help?
Ofcourse you can! You can create an "issue" and I will be able to get your suggestions out of there as an enhancement. Commands/Responses/Functional/Creative suggestions will **ALL** be seen. And you get a chance to be a tester of the VIP-System. Which will be included as well!

### Does the team need more developers/administrators/moderators?
Yes we do! You can apply by messaging me and there will be a **/apply** command! 

### Who can I contact for private questions / applications?
_Links will be put here.. (Being created!) You can contact Sadusko for now and he might forward you to another worker._

### How do I suggest answers or questions?
There is a link in the wiki which will help you out!

### The friends list is full, what do I do?
You don't do anything, check the next day or contact Sadusko in order for him to remove some friends. (Automated system which removes friends that don't say anything for 48 hours.)

## Any questions?
Leave them at Sadusko or you can make an issue on the issue tab!
